# Codeforces Solutions (All Ratings, with Explanations)

This repository contains a growing collection of C++ solutions to Codeforces problems, categorized by difficulty rating — starting from 800 and going all the way up to the highest rated problems on the platform.

Every solution is thoroughly commented to explain the thought process, algorithm, edge cases, and optimizations wherever applicable. This makes it beginner-friendly while still being a powerful resource for advanced learners.

---

## 🔍 Purpose

This repository is created to:

- Serve as a go-to reference for clean, readable, and explained C++ solutions
- Act as a long-term project to track improvement and contribute to the open-source CP community

## ✅ What's Included

- ✅ C++ solutions using STL and efficient logic
- ✅ Well-commented code explaining how and why each step works
- ✅ Named files that reflect problem intent
- ✅ Real Codeforces problems (links and IDs planned for future)
- ✅ Designed for self-learners

## 🧠 Who Should Use This

- Beginners trying to get past 800–1200 levels
- Intermediate programmers pushing past 1400–1800
- Advanced coders needing clean templates for hard problems

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- C++17
- Codeforces platform
- VSCode / Geany / Custom IDE setups

## 🛣️ Roadmap

- [x] 800 level problems
- [ ] 900 level problems
- [ ] 1000–1200 level problems
- [ ] 1300–1600 with editorial-style breakdowns
- [ ] 1700+ and harder problems with time complexity discussions
- [ ] Add tags (greedy, DP, binary search, etc.)
- [ ] Add links to problems and problem statements
- [ ] Markdown-based explanations alongside code (optional)

## 📌 How to Navigate

Each folder contains `.cpp` files. Open any file to see the problem solved with complete comments.

Example:
```cpp
/*
 * Problem: Float or Integer Checker
 * Logic: Check if decimal part is zero using floor and ceil
 * Input: long double a
 * Output: int a (if a is whole) or float floor(a) and decimal part
 */
