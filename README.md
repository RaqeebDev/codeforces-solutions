# Codeforces Solutions (All Ratings, with Explanations)

This repository contains a growing collection of C++ solutions to Codeforces problems, categorized by difficulty rating — starting from 800 and going all the way up to the highest rated problems on the platform.

Every solution is thoroughly commented to explain the thought process, algorithm, edge cases, and optimizations wherever applicable. This makes it beginner-friendly while still being a powerful resource for advanced learners.

##  How to Navigate

Each folder contains `.cpp` files. Open any file to see the problem solved with complete comments.

Example:
```cpp
/*
 * Problem: Float or Integer Checker
 * Logic: Check if decimal part is zero using floor and ceil
 * Input: long double a
 * Output: int a (if a is whole) or float floor(a) and decimal part
 */
