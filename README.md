# Codeforces Solutions (All Ratings)

This repository contains a growing collection of C++ solutions to Codeforces problems, categorized by difficulty rating ‚Äî starting from 800 and going all the way up to the highest rated problems on the platform.


Every solution is thoroughly commented to explain the thought process, algorithm, edge cases, and optimizations wherever applicable. This makes it beginner-friendly while still being a powerful resource for advanced learners. (pseudo explaination at last of each solution)
